Please ensure that all code follows the latest Swift and SwiftUI best practices, especially regarding video processing and UI design.

Please change the version number in the app for each change I told you to make. You are welcomed to choose between a major, minor, or patch version bump based on the nature of the changes. For example, if you made significant changes to the UI or added new features, consider a minor version bump. If you fixed bugs or made small improvements, a patch version bump is appropriate.
Also, please ensure that the app's version number is updated in the `Info.plist` file and that the version number is reflected in the app's UI, such as in the SettingsView.
You are allowed to change the version number in the app to reflect the changes made, such as from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0` or `1.0.1`, depending on the nature of the changes.
You are also allowed to change the app variants depending on the changes made, such as from `1.0 Beta` to `1.1 Beta` or `1.0.1 Release Candidate`, depending on the nature of the changes.
Thanks a lot for your help! :D
